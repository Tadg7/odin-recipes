    <p>
      While Ethiopian cuisine typically leans towards meat-centric dishes, Asa
      Tibs provides a convenient alternative with its fish-based approach.
      Particularly favored during Lent, this dish is a delightful choice for
      pescatarians or those seeking lighter and healthier meal options.

    <div>INGREDIENTS</div>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds white fish (cod, bass, or snapper)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon berbere spice</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil (or olive oil)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow (or red) onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>3 jalapeños, deseeded and diced</li>
      <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <div>INSTRUCTIONS</div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop the white fish into 1-inch cubes and place them in a container.
        Season the fish with berbere spice, ensuring all pieces are well-coated.
        Allow the fish to marinate in the refrigerator for a minimum of 15
        minutes, or up to 1 hour for optimal flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium skillet, warm 5 tablespoons of vegetable oil over high heat.
        Once the oil is hot, carefully add the marinated fish cubes to the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the fish on both sides until they are crispy and golden brown,
        approximately 5–6 minutes per side. Remove the fish from the heat and
        set it aside on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Season the fish
        with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the oil in the pan to 2–3 tablespoons. Turn down the heat to
        medium and add the thinly sliced onions, diced garlic, and grated ginger
        to the pan. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions become
        translucent and start to brown, which should take about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced jalapeños to the pan and continue to stir for an
        additional 4 minutes, just until the jalapeños are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the fried fish to the pan, squeeze one of the lime wedges over
        the top, and stir to combine. Sauté for an additional 1 minute to allow
        the flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pan from the heat and serve the spicy berbere fish stir-fry
        hot. Accompany it with the remaining lime wedges and your choice of
        side, such as injera, rice, or whole grain bread.
      </li>
