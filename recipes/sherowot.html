    <p>
      An essential part of Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine, its primary
      ingredient is powdered chickpeas or broad bean meal and often prepared
      with the addition of minced onions, garlic and, depending upon regional
      variation, ground ginger or chopped tomatoes and chili-peppers.

    <div>INGREDIENTS</div>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup oil</li>
      <li>½ cup chickpea flour</li>
      <li>2 medium onions pureed</li>
      <li>1 roma tomato pureed</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic chopped</li>
      <li>2 to 2 ½ cups of water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons berbere spice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 jalepeno chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <div>INSTRUCTIONS</div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the
        dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color-
        about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes
        until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
      <li>
        Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start
        to add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and
        an additional 1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add
        remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh,
        garlic powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.
      </li>

      <li>
        Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine
        and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.</li>
      <li>Serve with fresh injera.</li>
    </ol>
